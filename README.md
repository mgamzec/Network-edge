# Shapely

Shapely is a Python library for geometric operations and manipulations of geometric objects. It provides a set of geometric data types (such as points, curves, and polygons) and functions that enable the analysis and manipulation of spatial data. Shapely is particularly useful for tasks related to spatial analysis, such as computing geometric relationships between objects, performing geometric operations (e.g., union, intersection, buffer), and validating spatial relationships.
